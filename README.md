Pong

October's entry into my 1 Game Per Month Challange.

This repository contains a game of pong.

This entry was a trial to see if I could code a game in an hour. I failed.

This code took 1:39 to complete.

About 30 minutes was spent debugging and learning. It appears that my AABB and signed comparison code is all wrong.
